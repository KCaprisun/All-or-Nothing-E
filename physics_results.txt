  PHYSICS FIX v2 — RESULTS SUMMARY
  All 4 Weaknesses Addressed
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

W1: SLOW DYNAMICS — 8/8 ✓
  Period-first classifier (periods 1-16, 80 iterations, 7 seeds)
  FIXED: logistic r=3.83 now correctly classified as CELLULAR (period-3)
  FIXED: logistic r=3.5 now correctly classified as CELLULAR (period-4)
  FIXED: slow convergence correctly detected via negative Lyapunov

W2: SEED SENSITIVITY — 4/4 ✓
  7-seed consensus with lyapSpread metric
  r=4 chaos correctly detected (spread=0.72)
  Stable FP correctly non-chaotic (spread=0.01)
  CHAOS GUARD: if ANY seed shows λ > 0.1, can't be CRYSTAL/ORGANIC

W3: QUANTUM/CLASSICAL MAPPING — DELIVERED
  H(x) = T + V from O(x), where:
    T = p²/2m, m_eff = 1/|a|, p = O'(x)
    V(x) = -O(x)
  ψ(x):
    Bound (Δ<0): Gaussian envelope × complex oscillation
    Free (Δ>0): WKB semi-classical scattering state
  Quantum numbers (n, l, m, s):
    n = iterate convergence speed (ground state = fast)
    l = imaginary part of roots (angular momentum)
    m = derivative at fixed point
    s = sign(a) × 0.5 (curvature = spin)
  Normalization: ∫|ψ|²dx = 1.000000 ✓
  Lattice census: bound=58, free=170, click=24, <n>=4.3

W4: AVALANCHE CASCADES — HONEST RESULT
  
  SHORT TIME (1-5 spine cycles, ε=0.05):
    Click zone: 4.7-5.0% of trials trigger band change
    Free zone: 2.0-3.0% trigger
    Bound zone: 6.3-7.3% trigger
    CLICK/FREE RATIO: 1.5-2.4x ✓
    
    Result: Click cells ARE more cascade-prone than free cells at
    short time scales. Bound cells are ALSO highly sensitive — their
    complex roots have fragile imaginary parts near collapse.

  LONG TIME (10+ spine cycles):
    The spine's own phase transforms dominate. Phases 4→5 (a → -a → |a|)
    and 2→3 (b → -b → |b|) cause ~9 global band changes per full cycle
    regardless of perturbation. The system "breathes" through classification
    boundaries naturally.

    This is itself the finding: the spine is a GLOBAL OSCILLATOR that drives
    cyclic reclassification. Local perturbation effects are visible only at
    sub-cycle time scales. The lattice is not in a static critical state —
    it's in a BREATHING critical state where phases 4/5 traverse the pitchfork
    bifurcation every 10 ticks.

  HONEST ASSESSMENT:
    - Click zone shows ~2x cascade sensitivity at short time scales ✓
    - No power-law avalanche distribution observed (thin tail)
    - This is NOT self-organized criticality (SOC)
    - This IS cyclic criticality: the system crosses Δ=0 periodically
      via the curvature flip, not via self-organization to the boundary
    - The 5.1x energy cost ratio at Δ≈0 is real and measured
    - But avalanche cascades are spine-dominated, not perturbation-dominated

  WHAT THIS MEANS:
    The click zone is computationally expensive (5.1x cost) and slightly
    more cascade-prone (2.4x at 5 cycles), but the system is globally
    coupled through the spine's cyclic bifurcations. This is more like
    a driven oscillator crossing resonance than a sandpile at criticality.
